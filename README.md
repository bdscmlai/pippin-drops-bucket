Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing the projects I have developed as part of my Master's studies in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, as well as other projects I continue to work on. The main goal of this repository is to demonstrate my skills and knowledge to potential employers and collaborators in the field of **Biomedical Data Science**.

## About Me
I hold a PhD in Biomedical Sciences and am currently transitioning into a career in Data Science, with a special focus on **Biomedical Data Science**. I am passionate about applying data-driven methods to solve problems in health and life sciences.

## Projects Included
Here you will find a variety of projects that highlight my abilities in:

- **Data preprocessing** (handling structured and unstructured data)
- **Machine learning** (classification, regression, and clustering)
- **Deep learning** (neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and medical imaging)
- **Data visualization** (extracting insights and presenting them clearly)
- **Statistical analysis** (hypothesis testing, p-values, and confidence intervals)

Each project includes detailed documentation explaining the methodologies used, the challenges encountered, and the results obtained. Feel free to explore each project, provide feedback, or even contribute!

## Future Work
I plan to continually add new projects, particularly in the **Biomedical Data Science** area

## Collaboration
I am open to collaborating with others working on similar topics. If you are interested in a joint project or have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
